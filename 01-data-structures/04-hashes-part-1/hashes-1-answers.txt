Doubling the size of the array could be a poor solution for several reasons.
First, doubling the size of the array does not guarantee that there will not be another
collision, which could lead to doubling the size of the array indefinitely(in a worst case scenario).
Second, if the array continues to double in size it will create many potentially "unused spaces" which will
affect the memory required. Also, it seems that it would affect the processing speed as the doubling
process seeks to reorganize and shift keys around, multiple times.
